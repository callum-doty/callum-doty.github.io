        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">The Initial Challenge</h2>
        <p class="text-lg text-black leading-relaxed">Hired for the election-cycle of 2024, my role was to offload the trivial tasks of the senior graphic designers. After the cycle, I audited my peers and my own processes to see what could be improved. The time spent finding a specific file, either for accessing the working files or for content, through Dropbox took between 1 to 5 minutes. This was a significant chunk of time given hundreds of edits. If an application existed that could tag, categorize, and allow for user querying, it could save hours of time.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">The Decision: Build a Full-Stack Solution</h2>
        <p class="text-lg text-black leading-relaxed">The initial problem was clear: designers were wasting significant time searching for files. The solution was to find an existing solution that could semantically understand political mailers better than dropbox. Given no solution existed, I decided to build a full-stack application to intelligently catalog and retrieve project files. This self-initiated project leverages AI to help users find relevant files more efficiently. Spanning over six months, the project involved end-to-end execution, from user-centered design and project management to full-stack development and business systems analysis.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Action & Solution</h2>
        <p class="text-lg text-black leading-relaxed">I developed a full-stack application using a modern Python backend with Flask, PostgreSQL, and Redis, and a frontend built with Jinja2, Tailwind CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. The system integrates with the Dropbox API to access files, uses AI services from Anthropic and OpenAI for intelligent tagging, and Tesseract for OCR. The entire application is containerized with Docker for easy deployment. The application is designed to be deployed on a cloud platform and accessed through a web-interface. It is currently deployed to Render.</p>

        <p class="text-lg text-black leading-relaxed">This project was a fantastic opportunity to take a real-world business problem and solve it with a complete, end-to-end software solution. It allowed me to apply my full-stack skills to a project with tangible impact, from initial concept and user research to deployment and maintenance. It solidified my ability to manage a complex project and deliver a high-quality product that meets user needs.</p>
